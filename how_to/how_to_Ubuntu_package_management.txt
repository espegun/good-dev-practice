apt, apt-get and installing tarballs (.tar.gz or .tar.bz2)

Purpose
-------
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is Ubuntu's package handling system, which we interactivt with through the apt(-get) commands. The  apt is a simplified and more user-friendly version of apt-get, replaceing it's most commonly used commands, but not everything, so apt-get will still be needed for some cases.
You can also use the Ubuntu Software app on the Desktop [DOES IT WRITE TO APT AND VICE-VERSA?]

How it works
------------
sudo apt update  # Update your local database about available packages at the repos
sudo apt upgrade  # Upgrade the packages you have installed based on info from an update. Add the -y flag to always answer "Yes".
sudo apt full-upgrade # Upgrades and also removed packages which needs to be removed
sudo apt install <package_name>  # Install one or more packages (just add more package names). You may also specify =<version_number>. 
sudo apt remove <package_name>  # Remove package (binaries)
sudo apt purge <package_name>  # Remove package (binaries) and it's config files.
sudo apt autoremove  # Free diskspace by removing obsolete dependencies.
apt show <package_name>  # Get info about the package, dependencies and more.
which program  # Get the location of the package executable, normally under /usr/bin or /home/youruser.

### HIT

For tar.bz, open and read the README file, which may contain the installation instructions.
Personal choice has been to install stuff at /opt/[PACKAGENAME]

(sudo) tar xvzf ~/Downloads/PACKAGENAME.tar.gz # Done from /opt. If so, requires sudo.)
