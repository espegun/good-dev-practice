How it works
------------
Start by making sure you always have an updated version of pip. 
Remember that pip3 updates only one of your potentially many global Python-distributions or venvs, be conscious about which you target. Generally keep global installations pristine and install in venvs.
pip3 is the Python3 version of pip, handled the same way as python, so "pip" may have a softlink to pip3.X. 

$ apt install python3-pip  # Install pip for python3
$ pip --version  # Check version of pip
$ which pip  # Globally or inside a venv, check where your pip is located
$ [python3X -m] pip install --upgrade pip  # Make sure you have a recent pip version 

A "sudo" may be needed in front(?)
$ pip install [packagename]  [packagename]  # Install one or more packages, optionally with e.g. ==1.10 to specify version 
$ pip install --upgrade [packagename]
$ pip list  # Shows all the packages and versions installed (in the venv)
$ pip show [packagename]  # More detailed info about the package (also works with "pip show pip")
$ pip uninstall [packagename]

[ ] pip compile > requirements.txt (compile baserer seg på setup.py)
