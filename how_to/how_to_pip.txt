How it works
------------
Remember that pip(3) updates only one of your potentially many Python-distributions. Generally keep global installations pristine and install in venvs.

A "sudo" may be needed in front(?)
$ pip install [packagename]  # Alternatively with e.g. ==1.10 to specify version
$ pip install --upgrade [packagename]  # Make sure you have a recent pip version ($ pip --version)
$ pip --version  # Version and Python Make sure how have an updated version, if not --upgrade pip with pip
$ pip uninstall [packagename]
