make

Purpose
-------
Simple automation tool, typically for compiling and setting up projects. The key difference against normal bash-shell is that it only rebuilds files which needs to be rebuilt, because other files they depend on has been updated (newer than themselves).

How it works
------------
Builds from the end output and works backwards, rebuilding any dependencies if the source is newer than the existing target file. This could save a lot of time in large projects.
