# How to Git

## The purpose
The general purpose of version control is to:
* Being able to roll back to previous stages after messing up the code.
* Collaborate on common projects through merging of branches.
* Do pull requests and code reviews.

## How does it work?
It is possible to have a README.md in every folder, which will be displayed in the web GUI.
Tracked files have be staged or commited earlier, which untracked have not. A `.gitignore` file may be added and should contain a list of files and folders which should deliberately not be tracked, normally because these are machine generated and can be derived from the repo.

The staging area is used to organize what will be commited.


It is basically linked nodes.

## Useful commands
`$ git add *` Stage files which have been added or modified.<br/>
`$ git add -u` Remove files which have been deleted in the local repo.<br/>
