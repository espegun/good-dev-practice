# How to GitHub Actions

## The purpose
Automated testing, building and deployment which mean those processes are all done easier, quicker and more repeatable.

## How does it work?
[**Events**](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) like commit, opening or closing a pull requests may trigger the start of a workflow.<br/>
**Jobs** are actions like running tests, building containers or deploying those to the production environment.<br/>
**Workflows** are composed on a number of jobs.<br/>


GitHub looks for .yaml files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
