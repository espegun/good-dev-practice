# good-dev-practice
Espen's effort to move from writing code on and for my local PC to production quality code deployed in the cloud (AWS).

[Writing Great Python Code](https://docs.python-guide.org/#writing-great-python-code)  

## Learnt from PRs - to be moved at some point
- Use helper functions within functions to keep it readable.  
- Always use `snake_case` variable names in Python, also when referring to `CamelCaseClassNames`.  
- (Simen mener:) Rather move large if/else or other boilerplate sections into helper functions with intuitive
names.
- TBD
